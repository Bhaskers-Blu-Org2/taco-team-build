# Microsoft-taco-team-build
taco-team-build is a sample node module designed to avoid common pitfalls when building Cordova apps in a Team or Continuous Integration (CI) environment. It was put together for a set of tutorials for the Visual Studio 2015 Tools for Apache Cordova (TACo) featureset in Visual Studio but can be used with standard cordova projects.
